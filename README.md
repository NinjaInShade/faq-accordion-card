## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties/vars
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Learnt/practiced a couple things. Probably my most favourite challenge so far due to the cool looking illustration, accordion components and the overall design really made me like this one.

Firstly, I learned how to put together an image where you have smaller svg's that make it up. I used <img> elements and a background css class element to put it all together. Then I played around with relative positioning and overflow to give it the effect of popping out the card.

Next, I tried to design as semantic and accessible as possible accordion component. Then, I added a smooth max-height animation + some hover/active states. Javascript was used to toggle classes and to make sure only one accordion is open at one time.
